# Data Science Internship Project 1 — Advanced EDA & Feature Engineering

**DecodeLabs Internship 2026**

## 📌 Overview
This project transforms a raw e-commerce orders dataset into a clean,
analysis-ready dataset using statistical data wrangling techniques.
The focus is on mathematical rigor- not just running code, but
applying the correct statistical method for each problem.

## Objectives
- Handle missing data using **statistical imputation**
- Detect and neutralize **outliers** using the **IQR method**
- Engineer **5 new predictive features** from existing columns

## Dataset
**Source:** `Dataset-online_store_orders.xlsx`
**Size:** 1,200 rows × 14 columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| OrderID | Unique order identifier |
| Date | Order date |
| CustomerID | Unique customer identifier |
| Product | Product purchased |
| Quantity | Units purchased |
| UnitPrice | Price per unit |
| ShippingAddress | Delivery address |
| PaymentMethod | Payment type used |
| OrderStatus | Current order status |
| TrackingNumber | Shipment tracking ID |
| ItemsInCart | Number of items in cart at checkout |
| CouponCode | Coupon applied (if any) |
| ReferralSource | Marketing channel that drove the order |
| TotalPrice | Final order value |

## Methodology

### 1. Missing Value Treatment
`CouponCode` had **25.75%** missing values. Since this is a categorical
column representing "no coupon used," missing values were filled with
`"No Coupon"` — a domain-driven imputation rather than a statistical
guess.

### 2. Outlier Detection & Neutralization
Applied the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method on `Quantity`,
`UnitPrice`, `ItemsInCart`, and `TotalPrice`:

```
Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
```

Outliers were **capped (Winsorized)** using `numpy.clip()` rather than
deleted, preserving all 1,200 rows.

### 3. Feature Engineering
| New Feature | Formula / Logic |
|---|---|
| `RevenuePerItem` | `TotalPrice / Quantity` |
| `HasCoupon` | 1 if a coupon was used, else 0 |
| `OrderMonth` | Month extracted from `Date` |
| `OrderYear` | Year extracted from `Date` |
| `IsHighValueOrder` | 1 if `TotalPrice` > median, else 0 |

## Results
- **Final dataset:** 1,200 rows, 0 missing values
- **Target variable for future modeling:** `OrderStatus`
- Visual EDA confirms a balanced distribution across products,
  payment methods, and order statuses


## How to Run
Option 1 — Google Colab

Open Project1.ipynb in Google Colab
Upload Dataset-online_store_orders.xlsx to the Colab session (or mount Google Drive if stored there)
Run all cells: Runtime → Run all

Required libraries (pre-installed on Colab, no setup needed):
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl


Option 2 — VS Code

Open the project folder in VS Code
Install the Jupyter extension (if not already installed)
Open Project1.ipynb and select your Python interpreter (e.g. Anaconda)
Make sure the dataset file is in the same folder as the notebook
Run all cells using the ▶️ Run All button at the top of the notebook

Install dependencies (if not using Anaconda's base environment):
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statistical methods: IQR, Winsorization, domain-based imputation
